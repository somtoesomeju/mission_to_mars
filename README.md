# mission_to_mars

# Purpose
In this project, I am scraping data from the NASA website to create my own HTML page. This project shows the beauty of using flask and mongodb in web scraping

# Resources
- Tools: Python 3.8, Jupyter notebook 4.10.2, MongoDB community version 5.0, Visual Studio code 1.38.1
- Languages: Python, HTML

# Results
From my analysis, I was able to successfully scrape the wesbite and add it to a new website "index.html". This page stores the data from the NASA website. It also scraped and inserted my dataframe that was made in the jupyter notebook. The image can be seen [here](https://github.com/somtoesomeju/mission_to_mars/blob/main/Resources/scraped_mars_data.png).
